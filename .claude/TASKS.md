# TO-DO list

- ✅ ~~remove the i18n from the "add new custom domain" button~~ (Completed 2025-11-10)
- ✅ ~~make a permanent note in the project docs never to include i18n with any new features or UI~~ (Completed 2025-11-10)
- ✅ ~~add a link near the "custom domains" section that says something like "DNS configuration required" and opens a modal to user docs on what DNS config needs to be done. if there are already custom domains in place, the documentation that shows up in the modal should be dynamic and customized to refer to the extant custom domains.~~ (Completed 2025-11-10)
- mobile view doesn't scroll horizontally and pinch to zoom doesn't work. this is different from how the upstream source works. Specific example: https://rxresu.me/josh.dutcher/software-engineering-and-technology-leader does scroll horiztonally on mobile, and is zoomable. Fix that for resumes that use a custom domain.
