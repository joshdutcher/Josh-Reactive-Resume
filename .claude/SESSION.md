# SESSION.md - Current Session State

## Current Session - 2025-10-31
**Status**: Complete - MinIO Storage Implementation
**Focus**: Fix PDF generation and download by migrating from Cloudflare R2 to MinIO

### Session Context
Resumed interrupted session where PDF generation was failing with Cloudflare R2 authorization errors. Successfully diagnosed and resolved by deploying MinIO on Railway.

### Session Accomplishments

**Problem Solved**: PDF Download Authorization Errors
- Cloudflare R2 doesn't support S3's `setBucketPolicy()` API
- PDF uploads succeeded but downloads failed with XML authorization errors
- Storage service couldn't set public bucket access policy

**Solution Implemented**: MinIO Deployment
- Deployed MinIO service on Railway (S3-compatible storage)
- MinIO supports full S3 API including bucket policies
- Updated all storage environment variables
- PDF generation and downloads now working correctly

**Changes**:
1. ✅ Analyzed codebase storage configuration (no Cloudflare-specific code)
2. ✅ Created comprehensive MinIO setup guide
3. ✅ Deployed MinIO service on Railway with public domain
4. ✅ Updated 8 storage environment variables on Reactive Resume service
5. ✅ Tested PDF generation - successful download
6. ✅ Updated project documentation with infrastructure details

**Files Added**:
- `.claude/MINIO_SETUP.md` - Complete MinIO deployment guide for Railway

**Files Modified**:
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Added MinIO implementation section, infrastructure details

### Technical Implementation

**Railway Infrastructure**:
```yaml
MinIO Service:
  Image: minio/minio:latest
  Environment:
    MINIO_ROOT_USER: minioadmin
    MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: minioadmin123
  Ports: 9000 (API), 9001 (console)
  Public Domain: Generated

Reactive Resume Service:
  Storage Variables:
    STORAGE_ENDPOINT: minio.railway.internal
    STORAGE_PORT: 9000
    STORAGE_URL: https://<minio-domain>.railway.app/josh-reactive-resume
    STORAGE_BUCKET: josh-reactive-resume
    STORAGE_USE_SSL: false
```

**Storage Architecture**:
- Internal API: Service-to-service via `minio.railway.internal:9000`
- Public Downloads: Browser access via MinIO public domain
- Bucket Policy: Automatic public read access for user content
- Zero code changes required (configuration only)

### Git Activity

**New Commit**: `c657c344` - Docs: Add MinIO storage implementation documentation

**Commit Details**:
- 2 files changed, 272 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
- Added comprehensive MINIO_SETUP.md guide
- Updated CLAUDE.md with infrastructure architecture
- Clean documentation-only commit

**Push Status**: ✅ Successfully pushed to origin/main

### Current State

- **Branch**: main
- **Status**: 13 commits ahead of upstream/main
- **Build**: ✅ All services operational
- **PDF Generation**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Storage**: ✅ MinIO deployed and functional
- **Git Remote**: ✅ Synced with origin/main
- **Documentation**: ✅ Complete setup guides available

### Testing Results

✅ **PDF Generation**: Successfully generates PDFs via Browserless
✅ **PDF Upload**: Files uploaded to MinIO without errors
✅ **PDF Download**: Browser downloads work correctly
✅ **Custom Domains**: PDF access works via custom domains

### Next Steps

No immediate action required. System is fully operational.

**Maintenance**:
- Monitor MinIO storage usage and performance
- Verify PDF generation continues working after deployments
- Consider MinIO backup/persistence strategy if needed
