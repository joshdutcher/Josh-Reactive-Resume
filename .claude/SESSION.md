# SESSION.md - Current Session State

## Current Session - 2025-10-31
**Status**: Complete - Custom Domain Footer Cleanup
**Focus**: Hide footer section when viewing resumes via custom domains

### Session Context
User reported that when accessing resumes via custom domain, the footer section (separator + DigitalOcean badge + privacy policy links) appeared below the "Built with Reactive Resume" text, creating a cluttered appearance. The goal was to achieve a clean presentation with only the resume content and minimal branding.

### Session Accomplishments

**Problem Identified**: Footer Rendering on Custom Domains
- Custom domain resumes displayed via `HomePage` → `PublicResumePage` within `HomeLayout`
- `HomeLayout` always rendered `Header` and `Footer` components
- Footer included separator, logo, description, DigitalOcean badge, and theme switches
- Resulted in non-professional appearance on custom domains

**Solution Implemented**: Component-Level Conditional Rendering
- Moved custom domain detection logic into `Footer` component itself
- Footer checks loader data and returns `null` when displaying custom domain resume
- Maintains clean separation of concerns and React best practices
- Header remains visible but with invisible logo (existing behavior)

**Implementation Journey**:
1. ❌ First attempt: Conditional rendering in `HomeLayout` (only footer hidden)
2. ❌ Second attempt: Hide both header and footer in layout (caused infinite loading)
3. ✅ Final solution: Footer self-detects and returns null (works correctly)

**Changes**:
- Modified `Footer` component to detect custom domain resumes via `useLoaderData`
- Added early return `null` when `isCustomDomainResume` is true
- Reverted layout to original simple structure
- No changes to routing or data flow

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/client/src/pages/home/components/footer.tsx` - Added custom domain detection
- `apps/client/src/pages/home/layout.tsx` - Reverted to original structure

### Technical Implementation

**Detection Logic**:
```typescript
const data = useLoaderData<ResumeDto | null>();
const isCustomDomainResume = data && "id" in data && "data" in data;

if (isCustomDomainResume) {
  return null;
}
```

**Rendering Path**:
```
Custom Domain → homeLoader (fetches resume) → HomeLayout:
  - Header (logo invisible via existing logic)
  - HomePage → PublicResumePage (resume content)
  - Footer (returns null, doesn't render)
```

**Why This Approach Works**:
- Footer has access to route loader data via React Router context
- Component-level logic keeps conditional rendering localized
- No layout structure changes that could affect React rendering
- Maintains compatibility with existing custom domain detection

### Git Activity

**Commits**:
1. `7ea5923f` - Fix: Hide footer when viewing resumes via custom domains (incomplete)
2. `78c4a725` - Fix: Also hide header when viewing resumes via custom domains (broken)
3. `a88da54f` - Fix: Move custom domain footer detection to Footer component (working)

**Final Commit**: `a88da54f`
- 2 files changed, 25 insertions(+), 21 deletions(-)
- Clean implementation with proper conditional logic
- Reverted problematic layout changes

**Push Status**: ✅ Successfully pushed to origin/main

### Current State

- **Branch**: main
- **Status**: 16 commits ahead of upstream/main
- **Custom Domain Display**: ✅ Clean presentation without footer
- **Main Site Display**: ✅ Footer renders normally
- **Git Remote**: ✅ Synced with origin/main

### Expected Behavior After Deploy

**Custom Domain View**:
- Resume content (iframe)
- "Built with Reactive Resume" link
- PDF download button (fixed position)
- Theme switch (fixed position)
- NO header visible elements
- NO footer section

**Main Site View** (localhost/production):
- Full header with logo and donation banner
- Home page content sections
- Complete footer with branding and links

### Testing Checklist

After Railway deployment:
- [ ] Visit resume via custom domain
- [ ] Verify no footer section appears
- [ ] Verify "Built with Reactive Resume" link still shows
- [ ] Verify PDF download and theme switch work
- [ ] Visit main site and verify footer still appears
- [ ] Test on multiple custom domains if configured

### Lessons Learned

1. **Component-level logic preferred**: Conditional rendering works best at component level
2. **Layout changes risky**: Modifying layout structure can cause rendering issues
3. **Loader data access**: All components in route tree have access via `useLoaderData`
4. **Testing importance**: Deploy and test each approach before committing next change

### Next Steps

No immediate action required. Monitor deployment and user feedback.

**If Issues Occur**:
- Check browser console for React errors
- Verify Railway environment variables unchanged
- Test with cache cleared and hard reload
- Consider adding explicit logging to Footer component
